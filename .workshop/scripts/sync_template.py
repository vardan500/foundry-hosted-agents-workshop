"""Sync workshop machinery from the upstream template into this instance.

A workshop *instance* (a repo created from the template) sometimes needs the
latest workshop machinery — the authoring material under ``.workshop/`` and the
GitHub configuration under ``.github/`` — without touching the participant's own
progress. This CLI mirrors exactly those two trees from a chosen upstream ref
into the working tree and index, leaving everything else alone:

- ``travel_assistant/`` (the delivery the participant builds),
- ``.workshop_instance/`` (the per-instance step state + backups),
- ``README.md`` and ``.env`` (rendered / local values)

are never in the sync set, so the current step is preserved. Because the
mirrored paths are staged (including files deleted upstream), the caller can
commit and push them as one changeset.

Syncing never re-renders ``README.md`` or re-lays the current step's files. If a
sync updates the *current* step's authoring material and you want that reflected
in your working files, run the separate "reset current step" flow afterwards
(``advance_step.py --reset-current``): sync refreshes the machinery, then reset
re-applies the current step. Advancing already lays down fresh files, so a sync
taken just before moving on needs no reset.

Crucially, the sync commit carries a ``[skip-advance]`` sentinel in its message.
``advance-on-push.yml`` looks for that sentinel and skips advancing, so pushing a
sync to ``main`` refreshes the machinery **without moving to the next step**.

``--skip-workflows`` excludes ``.github/workflows/`` from the mirror. The built-in
``GITHUB_TOKEN`` in GitHub Actions is not permitted to push changes under
``.github/workflows/``, so the automated ``sync-template.yml`` runs with this flag
and stays fully tokenless — no Personal Access Token is required. Workflow-file
updates therefore flow only through a *local* run of this script (a human's Git
credentials carry the ``workflow`` scope). When workflows are skipped but differ
upstream, the script prints a NOTE so the maintainer knows to run the local sync.

Because ``--skip-workflows`` never overwrites the instance's ``advance-on-push.yml``,
it also skips the upstream-guard verification (there is no incoming guard to vet).
The sync commit still carries ``[skip-advance]``, so a correctly-configured
instance never advances on a sync; a local ``--skip-workflows --push`` therefore
trusts that the instance's existing guard already honors the sentinel.

This module is stdlib-only so it runs in GitHub Actions without installing the
workshop dependencies.
