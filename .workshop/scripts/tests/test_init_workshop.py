"""Tests for ``scripts/init_workshop.py``.

The init script is invoked from two GitHub Actions workflows, so the tests pin
its three contract guarantees: it renders the README (leaving ``.workshop/docs``
sources untouched as placeholders) when missing the marker, it creates the
marker, and it no-ops once the marker exists.
